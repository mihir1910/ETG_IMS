This repository is having all the fucntions and codes for making a Inventory Management System by using of File Handling and JSON files.


I made an Inventory Management System in Jupyter Notebook which is based on NoSQL Database.

In this Project:-

1. Purchased can be done by the user
2. Items can be added in the Inventory
3. Total Bill will be generated
4. Items sold is displayed.
5. Menu is  displayed, so user can see the list and buy accordingly.


To make this work:
1. JSON file is used.
2. Date and Time function is  displayed after buing the product.

Details given to per Product were:
1. Product ID
2. Name
3. Price
4. Category
5. Expiry Date
6. Manufacture Date
7. Quantity
